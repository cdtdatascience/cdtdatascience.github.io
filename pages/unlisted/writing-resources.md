title: Academic Writing Tips and Resources
---


This is a post that I wrote as a complement to Amos' [Academic Writing Rules](/pages/writing) post. 

Through my PhD years -- especially my first year -- I spent significant effort in trying to improve my academic writing. That effort consisted of a variety of activities:
1. Biweekly, dual-page mini papers on whatever I was thinking at the time. 
2. Teaching students and spending a good 5 hours of my week, writing for students, in a style that was attempting to cater for all sorts of audiences, while trying to describe what where complicated subjects as concisely and precisely as I could.
3. Reading a lot of student reports, much of which taught me what **not** to do, as well as a few examples of what **to** do.
4. Reading at least 4 new papers every week, sourced from the 'trending' in [arXiv-sanity](https://arxiv-sanity-lite.com). Critiquing the writing of these, and asking peers on their opinions.
5. Finding some 'good' examples of how to write via my daily paper reading and by community sourced *exemplars* such as [this Reddit post relating to well written papers](https://old.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/85cwiu/d_wellwritten_paper_examples/
)
6. In addition I have read and learned from Andrej Karpathy's [*PhD Survival Guide*](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/), especially the paper writing section.

When I am writing or reviewing a paper, I always refer to the following two resources, which by now have become my absolute go-to's to both help refresh my memory on how to write, and help me learn new things with every paper that I review/write:

1. [https://cs.stanford.edu/people/widom/paper-writing.html](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/widom/paper-writing.html) -- An incredible guide on how to write academic documents. 
2. [https://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/2010/01/how-to-write-a-scientific-abstract-in-six-easy-steps/](https://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/2010/01/how-to-write-a-scientific-abstract-in-six-easy-steps/) -- A six sentence method for abstracts, my favourite.
